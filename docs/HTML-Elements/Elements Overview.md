:::tip Note
Listings of attributes and events defined by browser versions assume that these attributes
and events generally remain associated with later versions of that browser. For example,
attributes defined by Internet Explorer 4 are valid for Internet Explorer 5 and higher, and
attributes defined for Netscape 4 remain valid for Netscape browsers as well as Firefox. Safari
information focuses on Safari 2 and 3. The Google Chrome browser is not always directly called
out in this book, but, given its reliance on the WebKit engine, you should assume Safari entries
will apply to this browser. Compatibility pre-Opera 4 is determined via research not testing; in
cases of uncertainity we assume support from Opera 4. Of course, reasonably this is more for
historical accuracy and will simply not affect modern Web developers.
